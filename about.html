            <h2>Who's Fern?</h2>
            <p>The cafe is named after my grandmother Fern who was known for her red hair. My nieces and nephews used to call her “Gamma Goffee” because she always asked for a cup of coffee to sip when she arrived. She stayed busy dancing polka, volunteering, and playing 500 every chance she got. She was a constant in my life. Every milestone I had, she was there because family was so important to her. I always knew I had a place in her home because wherever she lived, the guest bedroom was called “Julie’s Room.” I even lived with her for a time after college, and she said her fondest memories were the mornings where I would make us a breakfast of coffee and waffles.This cafe is my way of showing her that she will always have a place in my heart because I couldn't have done it without her support throughout my life.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I have been working in the food and hospitality industry since I was 15 years old in both corporate and small business. I’ve been a lead cake decorator, and a baking assistant to a French-trained pastry chef, and now opening a cafe of my own. Those years have taught me to truly value small business because they are the ones with heart, passion, and integrity.</p>
            <p>I am also an artist who dabbles in pottery as well as mixed media. I love to challenge myself with new adventures, whether that is sculpting a cake, trying a new recipe or flavor combination, or exploring a new art medium.</p>
            <p>My home has always been a sanctuary for my friends and family where they can come relax, create, and/or recharge. I hope to bring a similar atmosphere to the cafe where customers can feel at home.</p>
